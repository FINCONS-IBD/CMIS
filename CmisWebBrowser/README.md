# Cmis Web Browser  

The platform interacts with a Content Management System (CMS) supporting the CMIS standard to process several types of structured documents (e.g., Word, PDF, Excel, Power Point, etc.) or blogs/wikis, extracts and categorizes the information they contain and presents the outcomes to the user through a web application. The choice to refer to a CMS system is due to the enterprise increasing habit to manage company’s documentation through a specialised system that enforces control on the information, on the usage of company’s formats and rules. In order to support a variety of CMSs, the PSYMBIOSYS knowledge sharing system refers to the OASIS CMIS (Content Management Interoperability Services standard3) to gain access to CMS’s managed contents. Therefore, the PSYMBIOSYS CMIS Knowledge Browser provides access to any CMS providing a CMIS API, even if, for this release, the open source Alfresco CMS4 has been used and a running instance of this CMS has been made available to the PSYMBIOSYS consortium. The OASIS CMIS standard not only provides a standard API to gain access to information managed by the CMS, but it also provides a powerful query language to perform specific searches on managed information using both data as well as metadata. The PSYMBIOSYS CMIS Knowledge Browser platform consists of two main sections:  

* a Syntactic section that provide knowledge extraction capabilities, queries via CMIS query language, visual exploration of directories and sub-directories, uniform access to documents’ content and metadata independently from the document’s format (PDF, Word or Excel documents, blogs or wikis, etc.).  

* a Semantic section that provides document search capabilities based on the SPARQL query language, visual presentation of RDF triples and statistics charts of concept present in the document linked to DbPedia and WikiData ontologies.  

The Semantic Section (both the SPARQL Query Editor and the Web Application UI) is based on the NLP Processing result then the NLP batch represents an important requirement.
